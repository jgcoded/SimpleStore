# Simple Store

A simple front-end for a website written in [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org).
This was the result after completing the [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) [Shaping up with AngularJs](https://www.codeschool.com/pages/angular-1-vs-2) course.

# Running the site

Download [Bower](https://bower.io/) and then run the following commands.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jgcoded/SimpleStore
$ bower install
```

And then open the *index.html* page in your favorite browser.
